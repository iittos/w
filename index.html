    <p><centre>Christian Action reports that there are approximately 13,000 asylum seekers in Hong Kong— individuals in Hong Kong who've yet to receive 'refugee' status. As such, they live in wretched conditions, surviving off government welfare for housing, food and transport, alongside no rights to work or volunteer. Most asylum seekers who travel to Hong Kong think its status as a well-developed region makes it a safe place to take refuge in, when in truth the region has yet to sign the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. In other words, they must go through a long application known as 'non-refoulement' to be acknowledged as a refugee, which can take years. Even after being granted refugee status, they're unable to become Hong Kong residents, and will have to restart their lives in a third host country once they get back on their feet. In the meantime, they find themselves stranded in Hong Kong, dealing with harsh conditions and poor quality of life. This is not a dystopian fantasy, but reality— how Hong Kong feels they should treat those who flee their country to escape torture, terrorism, and detention. And it <i>needs</i> to change.< </h2>
